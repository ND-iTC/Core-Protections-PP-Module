This PP-Module was developed by the Network international Technical Community with representatives from industry, Government agencies, Common Criteria Test Laboratories, and members of academia.

== Preface

=== Objective of Document

This document presents the Common Criteria (CC) PP-Module to express the security functional requirements (SFRs) and security assurance requirements (SARs) for enforcement of Core Protections on a system in addition to the Base-PP for a Network Device specified below. Evaluation Activities for the Base-PP are given in [SD-ND] and the additional Evaluation Activities that specify the actions the evaluator performs to determine whether a product satisfies the additional SFRs captured within this PP-Module are described in [SD-CP].

=== Scope of Document

The scope of the PP-Module within the development and evaluation process is described in the Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation [CC]. In particular, a PP-Module defines the additional IT security requirements of a generic type of TOE and specifies the functional and assurance security measures to be offered by that TOE to meet stated requirements. A PP-Configuration results from the combination of at least one PP- Module with its Base-PPs, without any additional content (for details see [CC1], section 9.6).

== Intended Readership

The target audiences of this PP-Module are developers, CC consumers, system integrators, evaluators and schemes.

Although the PP-Configuration, PP-Module and SDs may contain minor editorial errors, PP- Modules are recognized as living documents and the iTCs are dedicated to ongoing updates and revisions. Please report any issues to the ND iTC.

==  

== Introduction

The scope of this PP-Module is to describe the security functionality of a device enforcing Core Protections in terms of [CC] and to define functional and assurance requirements for such products. This PP-Module is intended for use with the following Base-PPs:

=== Collaborative Protection Profile for Network Device (NDcPP) v2.2E

This Base-PP is valid because the module exists to provide additional Secure Requirements. This is functionality that typically will be implemented by a network device.

=== PP-Module Introduction

This chapter provides introduction to the PP-Module which consists of sections of the current document.

==== PP-Module Reference Identification

==== PP-Module TOE Overview

This PP-Module defines requirements for the evaluation of the Core Protections in addition to the requirements of the Base-PP which specifies requirements on network devices in general. These Core Protections includes Password Defaults, Default Administrator Privileges, Separate Trusted Path, Secure Communication Channels, and Automatic Update Management. These protections ensure that the TOE provides a ‘Secure by Default’ approach to Security.

No requirements related to virtualization are contained in this document because this topic is covered in the related Base-PP [PP-ND].

An introduction to distributed TOEs is contained in the related Base-PP [PP-ND].

==== PP-Module TOE Use Cases

The combination of the Base-PP and this PP-Module specifically addresses providing a ‘Secure by Default’ implementation to Security Administrators and users of the TOE.

Secure by Default is the idea that default configuration and functionality is incorporated into the device to ensure the most secure settings possible. Secure configurations include the enforcement of automatic trusted updates, changing of all default account passwords or authentication mechanisms, and restriction of default administrator privileges. The default functionality claimed within this PP-Module are a supplement to the Security Functional Requirements

This PP-Module may be used in PP-Configurations together with other PP-Modules in the future, to provide additional features such as application filtering.

==== Consistency Rationale

The PP-Module specifies only one Base-PP and fully inherits the conformance claim of the Base-PP.

The PP-Module specifies a TOE functionality claim of secure-by-default which is an additional level of security above that of the more general TOE type defined in the Base-PP ('Network Device'). The PP-Module does not interpret any element of the Base-PP except for the impact of the more strict TOE type definition.

The PP-Module specifies only additional threats which are independent from the threats of the Base-PP and does not refine or interpret any threat defined in the Base-PP. The additional threats are mapped only to additional SFRs specified in this PP-Module (not to any SFRs defined in the Base-PP) as well as some supporting SFRs (FAU_GEN.1, FMT_SMF.1) that extend existing SFRs in the Base-PP to cover the needs of the SFRs additionally defined in this PP-Module. So Base-PP and PP-Module are fully consistent regarding the threat definition.

The PP-Module specifies no additional assumptions compared to the Base-PP and does not refine or interpret any assumption defined in the Base-PP. The assumption A.NO_THRU_TRAFFIC_PROTECTION defined in the Base-PP applies to the interfaces defined in the Base-PP only, though. The Base-PP and PP-Module therefore do not conflict with each other.

== CC Conformance

=== PP-Module Conformance Claims

As defined by the references [CC1], [CC2] and [CC3], this PP-Module:

* conforms to the requirements of Common Criteria v3.1, Release 5
* is Part 2 extended, Part 3 conformant
* does not claim conformance to any PP, PP-Module or PP-Configuration.

This PP-Module inherits Exact Conformance as required from the specified Base-PP and as defined in [Exact Conformance Addendum]. This means that STs must claim exact conformance to PP-Configurations including this PP-Module and its Base-PP. The evaluation activities from [SD-CP] & [SD-ND] shall be used for the evaluation.

== Introduction to Distributed TOEs

All considerations provided in the Base-PP about Distributed TOEs apply.

=== Allocation of Requirements in Distributed TOEs

All allocations of requirements in distributed TOEs as defined in the Base-PP apply. For the additional SFRs defined in this PP-Module the allocations specified in the table below apply. For a distributed TOE, the SFRs in this PP-Module need to be met by the TOE as a whole, but not all SFRs will necessarily be implemented by all components. The following categories are defined in order to specify when each SFR must be implemented by a component:

* *All Components (“All”)* – All components that comprise the distributed TOE must independently satisfy the requirement.
* *At least one Component (“One”)* – This requirement must be fulfilled by at least one component within the distributed TOE.
* *Feature Dependent (“Feature Dependent”)* – These requirements will only be fulfilled where the feature is implemented by the distributed TOE component (note that the requirement to meet the PP-Module as a whole requires that at least one component implements these requirements if they are specified in section 6).

Table 1 specifies how each of the additional SFRs in this PP-Module must be met, using the categories above.

Table 1: Additional SFRs for Distributed TOEs

The ST for a distributed TOE must include a mapping of SFRs to each of the components of the TOE. (Note that this deliverable is examined as part of the ASE_TSS.1 and AVA_VAN.1 Evaluation Activities as described in [SD-ND, 5.1.2] and [SD-ND, 5.6.1.1] respectively.) The ST for a distributed TOE may also introduce a “minimum configuration” and identify components that may have instances added to an operational configuration without affecting the validity of the CC certification. [SD-ND, B.4] describes Evaluation Activities relating to these equivalency aspects of a distributed TOE (and hence what is expected in the ST).

== Security Problem Definition

A Network Device implementing the Core Protection requirements is intended to provide a minimal set of configurations while strengthening the security of the device by default.

It has the ability to restrict administrator privileges, default passwords, and trusted communication paths as well as enforce automatic updates by default with minor interaction from the Security Administrator during initial configuration. These functional requirements define permitted password configuration and administrator privileges as well as application of updates and security of communication between the TOE and remote users.

=== Threats

==== Communications with the Network Device

===== T.NONSECURE_CHANNEL

An attacker is positioned on a communications channel or elsewhere on the network infrastructure. Attackers may engage in communications with the application software or alter communications between the application software and other endpoints in order to compromise it.

SFR Rationale:

* The TSF uses a physically separate network interface to ensure that it can support separation of its management network (FTP_TRP_EXT.2)
* The TSF ensures all IT entity communication channels are secured using a cryptographic service (FTP_ITC_EXT.1)
* The TSF ensures any access to the management debug interface is audited to ensure all actions performed on the interface can be linked to a security administrator account (FAU_DRM_EXT.1)
* The TSF ensures all cryptographic services are configured to be compliant to the base protection profile by default and all default host keys, certificates, and pre-shared keys are changes (FCS_IPSEC_EXT.2, FCS_SSHS_EXT.2, FCS_SSHC_EXT.2, FCS_TLSS_EXT.3, FCS_TLSC_EXT.3)

==== Timely Updates

===== T.UNPATCHED_SOFTWARE

An attacker can act through unprivileged software on the same computing platform on which the application executes. Attackers may provide maliciously formatted input to the application in the form of files or other local communications.

SFR Rationale:

* The TSF, during initial configuration, requires the security administrator to specify a remote update server which provides automatic updates to the TOE in order to provide necessary updates and fixes (FPT_TUD_EXT.3)

==== Administrator Access

===== T.UNRESTRICTED_ACCESS

Threat Agents may act gain access through authorized credentials to functionality of the device in which they are not permitted. Less restrictive default privileges may permit the Threat Agents to corrupt known systems.

SFR Rationale:

* The TOE, during initial configuration, will prompt the security administrator to change all default credentials present on the device to ensure known or weak passwords are no longer present during normal operation of the device(s). (FIA_PMG_EXT.2)

===== T.DEFAULT_PASSWORDS

Threat agents may be able to take advantage of weak or known default passwords to gain privileged access to the device. Having privileged access to the device provides the attacker unfettered access to the network traffic and may allow them to take advantage of any trust relationships with other network devices.

SFR Rationale:

* The TOE, during initial configuration, will prompt the security administrator to change all default credentials present on the device to ensure known or weak passwords are no longer present during normal operation of the device(s). (FIA_PMG_EXT.2)

=== Organization Security Policy

An organizational security policy is a set of rules, practices, and procedures imposed by an organization to address its security needs. All organizational security policies of the Base-PP apply also to this PP-Module. No additional policies are defined.

== Security Objectives

=== Security Objectives for the TOE

The following subsections describe objectives for the TOE. Since the Base-PP does not specify any Objectives for the TOE this section contains only additional Objectives for the TOE related to the PP-Module but independent from the Base-PP.

==== O.MONITOR_DEBUG

The TOE, during regular operation, collects auditable events relating to the invocation of the debug interface to ensure access to this privileged interface is monitored and recorded.

==== O.SECURE_CHANNELS

The TOE, following initial configuration, allows for remote administrator access through a separate physical network interface. This interface is configured by default once enabled.

==== O.SECURE_DEFAULTS

The TOE during initial configuration, requires the security administrator to update default authentication credentials and administrator roles to ensure known weak passwords are not present and no user account has full access to the system without explicit configuration. The TOE also ensures all cryptographic operations are compliant with the base PP requirement and enforce an update to host keys, pre-shared keys, and certificates that are provided on the box.

==== O.AUTOMATIC_UPDATES

The TOE firmware and software is updated automatically on a timely basis in response to releases provided on a remote server.

=== Security Objectives Rationale

==== Coverage for Objectives for the TOE

The following table provides a mapping of the objectives for the TOE to threats and policies, showing that each objective is covered by at least one threat or policy.

== Security Functional Requirements

The individual SFRs are specified in the sections below. SFRs in this section are mandatory SFRs that any conformant TOE must meet. Additional optional SFRs may also be adopted from those listed in Appendix A.

For chapters 6.3 to 6.5 information is provided in each chapter whether the PP-Module specifies additional SFRs not existent in the Base-PP or whether the definitions in the PP- Module impact SFRs already existing in the Base-PP. The ST author has full discretion to complete all other assignments/selections, include/exclude optional SFRs/etc. of the Base-PP as desired because this PP-Module doesn’t impact them.

For a distributed TOE, the ST author should reference Table 1 for guidance on how each SFR should be met. The table details whether SFRs should be met by all TOE components, by at least one TOE component or whether they are dependent upon the feature being implemented by the TOE component. The ST for a distributed TOE must include a mapping of SFRs to each of the components of the TOE. (Note that this deliverable is examined as part of the ASE_TSS.1 and AVA_VAN.1 Evaluation Activities as described in [SD-ND, 5.1.2] and [SD-ND, 5.6.1.1] respectively.

The Evaluation Activities defined in [SD-ND] and [SD-CP] describe actions that the evaluator will take in order to determine compliance of a particular TOE with the SFRs. The content of these Evaluation Activities will therefore provide more insight into deliverables required from TOE Developers.

=== Conventions

The conventions used in descriptions of the SFRs are as follows:

=== SFR Architecture

An overview of the SFR Architecture can be found in the Base-PP [PP-ND, 6.2]. In addition to the SFR Architecture described in the Base-PP, Figures 1, 2, and 3 below need to be considered since it reflects the Core Protections SFR Architecture.

SFRs in Appendix A can be included in the ST if they are provided by the TOE but are not mandatory in order for a TOE to claim conformance to this PP-Module.

*_Application Note 1_*

_Additional audit events will apply to the TOE depending on the optional requirements adopted from Appendix A._

_If changing of default account credentials is performed through the use of a local connection during the initial configuration of the TOE, before the audit service is operational, the auditable event requirement for FIA_PMG_EXT.2 is not applicable. In any instance in which the initial configuration of the TOE is performed via a remote connection, an audit must be generated when a default account credential is changed._

==== Debug and Recovery Audit Mechanisms (FAU_DRM_EXT.1)

===== FAU_DRM_EXT.1 Debug and Recovery Audit Mechanisms

*FAU_DRM_EXT.1 Debug and Recovery Audit Mechanisms*

*FAU_DRM_EXT.1.1* The TSF shall be able to generate an auditable event prior to access being provided or functionality executed through any debug interface.

*_Application Note 2_*

_The use of “debug interfaces” allows a person to potentially bypass auditing, e.g. by making configuration changes directly to a database or by modifying file contents directly on the filesystem. Because debug interfaces sometimes provide “super-user” access, audit mechanisms while inside the debug interface could be defeated._

_The intent of this requirement is that an audit record be generated when the debug interface is invoked, prior to any actual access being provided through the debug interface. This way, a reliable record can be generated that a non-auditable mode was entered._

_If the debug interface has been disabled or is not accessible, this requirement has been met._

=== Identification and Authentication (FIA)

This section requires the TOE to ensure that it does not reuse old packet information when transmitting new packets. The SFRs in this chapter are additional SFRs defined in this PP- Module which are not present in the Base-PP.

==== Password Management (FIA_PMG_EXT)

===== FIA_PMG_EXT.2 Password Defaults

*FIA_PMG_EXT.2 Default Credentials*

*FIA_PMG_EXT.2.1* The TSF shall identify to the Security Administrator, during initial configuration, all default accounts present and shall ensure that the passwords on all such accounts have been changed from the default values.

*FIA_PMG_EXT.2.2* The TSF provide a default password/credential policy, prior to initial configuration, that enforces a password policy with the following requirements:

* minimum password length of _[assignment: minimum of 8]_ characters,
* at least _[assignment: minimum of 1]_ upper case letter(s),
* at least _[assignment: minimum of 1]_ lower case letter(s),
* at least _[assignment: minimum of 1]_ number(s),
* at least _[assignment: minimum of 1]_ special character(s),
* additional password complexity requirements: [+++selection: dictionary words, repetitive characters, context-specific words, sequential characters, _[assignment: other password restriction method(s)],_ none+++].

*FIA_PMG_EXT.2.3* The TSF shall identify the default client certificates provided during initial configuration and ensure that the Security Administrator is prompted to generate new certificates.

*_Application Note 3_*

_This requirement does not mandate that a network device be non-operational until a password is set/changed, but it does require that the TOE may not be further configured without setting/changing administrative passwords. An administrative interface is defined as any interface which can configure the TOE or read security-sensitive information from the TOE._

_The following cases apply for changing of credentials for default accounts:_

* _change of password during initial installation/configuration_
* _change of password on first authentication on default administrative account_
* _change of credentials on initialization or first enablement of account or service_

*FPT_AEX_EXT.1 Anti-Exploitation Capabilities*

*FPT_AEX_EXT.1.1* The TSF shall not request to map memory at an explicit address except for [_assignment: list of explicit exceptions_].

*_Application Note 4_*

_Requesting a memory mapping at an explicit address subverts address space layout randomization (ASLR)._

*FPT_AEX_EXT.1.2* The TSF shall [+++selection+++:

* +++not allocate any memory region with both write and execute permissions,+++
* +++allocate memory regions with write and execute permissions for only [_assignment: list of functions performing just-in-time compilation_+++].

*_Application Note 5_*

_Requesting a memory mapping with both write and execute permissions subverts the platform protection provided by DEP. If the TOE performs no just-in-time compiling, then the first selection must be chosen._

*FPT_AEX_EXT.1.3* The TSF shall be built with stack-based buffer overflow protection enabled.

==== Trusted Update (FPT_TUD)

===== FPT_TUD_EXT.3 Automatic Update Management

*FPT_TUD_EXT.3 Automatic Update Management*

*FPT_TUD_EXT.3.1* The TSF shall ensure that an automatic query can be performed to the update server at an interval between [_assignment: minimum one hour, maximum one month_].

*FPT_TUD_EXT.3.2* The TSF shall allow the Security Administrator to [selection: automatically download and install updates, automatically download updates, manually download and install updates] once notified of a new release.

*_Application Note 6_*

_The TSF will provide the ability to communicate with a remote update server to periodically query for new releases of the TOE firmware/software image and notify the Security Administrator that a new image has become available._

=== Trusted Path/Channels (FTP)

The SFRs in this chapter are additional SFRs defined in this PP-Module which are not present in the Base-PP.

==== Inter-TSF Trusted Channel (Refinement)

===== FTP_ITC_EXT.1 Inter-TSF Trusted Channel

*FTP_ITC_EXT.1.1* The TSF shall *be capable of using* [*_selection: IPsec, SSH, TLS, DTLS, HTTPS_*] to provide a trusted communication channel between itself and *authorized IT entities supporting the following capabilities: audit server,* [*selection: _authentication server, +++update server,+++ [assignment: other capabilities], no other capabilities_*] that is logically distinct from other communication channels and provides assured identification of its end points and protection of the channel data from *disclosure and detection of modification of the channel data*.

*FTP_ITC_EXT.1.2* The TSF shall *permit the TSF or the authorized IT entities* to initiate communication via the trusted channel.

*FTP_ITC_EXT.1.3* The TSF shall initiate communication via the trusted channel for [_assignment: list of services for which the TSF is able to initiate communications_].

*_Application Note 7_*

_This SFR is a refinement of the requirement within the Base-PP. This refinement includes the mandatory inclusion of a secure communication channel to the update server used for automatic updates._

==== Trusted Path (FTP_TRP)

===== FTP_TRP_EXT.2 Trusted Management Path

*FTP_TRP_EXT.2 Trusted Management Path*

*FTP_TRP_EXT.2.1* The TSF shall provide a remote administration interface via a trusted path separate from other network traffic that is enforced by [selection: access control list, VLAN, physical Ethernet].

*_Application Note 8_*

_An administrative interface is defined as any interface which can configure the TOE or read security-sensitive information from the TOE._

_DHCP is not considered an administrative interface, because it does not change the persistent configuration of the TOE._

== Optional Requirements

As indicated in the introduction to this PP-Module, the baseline requirements (those that must be performed by the TOE) are contained in the body of this PP-Module. Additionally, there are optional requirements specified in this Appendix.

The optional requirements in this Appendix comprise requirements that can be included in the ST, but are not mandatory for a TOE to claim conformance to a PP-Configuration that includes this PP-Module.

If a TOE fulfils any of the optional requirements, the vendor is encouraged to add the related functionality to the ST. However, inclusion of these options is not necessary to implement the related functionality to conform to the PP-Module requirements, regardless of whether or not the product implements the functionality.

=== E.3 SFR Sufficiency Rationale

The following rationale provides justification for each security objective for the TOE, showing that the SFRs are suitable to meet and achieve the security objectives:

[width="100%",cols="43%,57%",options="header",]
|===
|*Objectives* |*Rationale*
|O.MONITOR_DEBUG a|
____
The TOE ensures invocation of the debug interface is audited (FAU_DRM_EXT.1) to prevent any modification of the TOE going unrecorded.
____

|O.SECURE_CHANNELS a|
____
The TOE provides an isolated management interface (FTP_TRP_EXT.2) to ensure all traffic is properly secured and monitored for easier detection of attempted malicious attacks on the network.
____

|O.SECURE_DEFAULTS a|
____
The TOE prevents known default credentials from remaining in configuration follow installation by requiring the security administrator to define new credentials during the installation process (FIA_PMG_EXT.2).

The TOE ensures all cryptographic services are compliant to the base PP by default and enforce updates to host keys, certificates, and pre-shared keys (FCS_SSHS_EXT.2, FCS_SSHC_EXT.2, FCS_TLSS_EXT.3, FCS_TLSC_EXT.3, FCS_IPSEC_EXT.2)
____

|O.AUTOMATIC_UPDATES a|
____
The TOE prevents out-of-date software/firmware versions containing documented or exploitable vulnerabilities by requiring the security administrator to connect the TOE to a remote server that provides up-to-date software/firmware images (FPT_TUD_EXT.3).
____

|===

Table 8: SFR Sufficiency Rationale

=== E.4. SFR Sufficiency Rationale

The PP-Module identifies FTP_ITC_EXT.1 as a refinement of the requirement defined within the Base-PP. This refinement includes only the addition of the update server used to meet FTP_TUD_EXT.3.
